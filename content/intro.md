# Software Engineering for Scientific Computing

Course by Henry Schreiner & Romain Teyssier. Some material written by Gabriel
Perez-Giz for previous iterations of this course. Thanks to Troy Comi for
extensive review, additions, and corrections.

The goal of this course is to teach basic tools and principles of writing good
code, in the context of scientific computing. Specific topics include an
overview of relevant compiled and interpreted languages, build tools and source
managers, design patterns, design of interfaces, debugging and testing,
profiling and improving performance, portability, and an introduction to
parallel computing in both shared memory and distributed memory environments.
The focus is on writing code that is easy to maintain and share with others. You
will develop these skills through a series of programming assignments and a
group project.

[WebAssembly version](https://se-for-sci.github.io/live) •
[Binder version](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/se-for-sci/se-for-sci.github.io/main?urlpath=lab)

Note the WebAssembly version does not have a shell, and `time.sleep` doesn't
work (the web is async).
