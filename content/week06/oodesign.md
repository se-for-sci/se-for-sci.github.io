# Object Oriented Design

## Intro

Why design classes? We want an interface that is _easy to use correctly_ and
_hard to use incorrectly_. OOP gives us tools to remove user mistakes via API
design, rather than by asking users nicely to follow conventions. We remove the
potential for mistakes and enhance readability.

We will _not_ be giving up on the other things we've emphasized before, like
_modularity_. You can make bad designs with OOP, just like you can make bad
designs with any paradigm. In fact, with OOP you can make some _really_ bad
spaghetti code if you really want to prove how smart you are[^1] or want job
security!

Let's define some terminology we've been seeing, along with a bit of new stuff:

- **Encapsulation** (meaning 1): The idea of bundling data & operations together
  under one roof.
- **Encapsulation** (meaning 2): Isolating the implementation and only providing
  access to a minimal "public" part.
- **Object**/**instance**: A variable holding data with a type holding
  functions.
- **Attribute**: Something accessible on an object.
- **Member**: A data attribute stored in each object.
- **Method**/**Member function**: A callable attribute stored in a class and
  callable from an object
- **Constructor**/**Initializer**: A function that creates instances of a class
- **Destructor**: A function that runs when an instance is destroyed. Much more
  interesting in non-garbaged collected languages (C++); they tend to be rather
  useless when combined with a garbage collector, because you can't guarantee
  when or if they will be called.
- **Inheritance**: When one class uses another as a starting point, and just
  **extends** by adding or **overrides** existing methods.
- **Composition** (meaning 1): Adding instances of classes as members of a new
  class.
- **Composition** (meaning 2): Combining non-overlapping classes via multiple
  inheritance.
- **Interface**: A collection of methods/members that need to be provided in
  order to be used.

### Why should we use classes and objects?

- Pass around and keep related values together.
- **Inheritance** and **Composition** can be used to keep code DRY.
- Clean way to establish interfaces (via Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) or
  Protocols (see static typing))
- Ensure required code is run (constructors, destructors, context managers, etc)
- Associate functions to a specific type (varies by language)

```{admonition} Interfaces
Python refers to an Interface (Java terminology, technically) as a Protocol. C++20
calls it a Concept. The basic idea is simply that a set of methods/members are
required in order for a class to be used, without requiring formal inheritance.
We'll save this until we look at static typing, however.

We also will refer to "interface" meaning the interaction with your API by
consumers (possibly also you).
```

In languages without type based dispatch, classes are an ideal way to ensure
functions are associated with the type they were intended to be called on. Even
in languages with multiple dispatch, they still help with discoverability, such
as tab completion in editors.

### Why inheritance?

If you want two classes both to have a set of data or methods specified by the
same code, you can put the code in class A and have class B "inherit" that code.
We then say that A is the **parent class** or **super class** of B, and that B
is the child class or subclass of A.

- Provides the concept of "is a" (`isinstance` / `issubclass` in Python).
- Provides a way to "realize" or "implement" a specified interface (ABC or
  Protocol).

For example, in `content/week06/geom_example/geometry/classic.py`, `Shape` is a
base class with `area()` and `parameter()` methods. It doesn't know how to
compute those - they are abstract. This means you can't instantiate `Shape()`,
doing so would give you an error (from the `abc` module). However, the
subclasses of `Shape` like `Rectangle` and `Circle` do know how to compute this,
so they can be instantiated.

When you require a `Shape` object, you can accept any concrete subclass of
`Shape` (no abstract methods left). Again, when we get to static typing, we'll
learn how to formalize this requirement, for now, we have to trust duck typing
and willpower to avoid using anything that's not in `Shape` when we accept it as
an argument.

### Why composition/aggregation?

- Provides the concept of "has a", or "inherent part of". `Kidney` is a part of
  `Human`, for example.
- **Composition** is generally when the contained object's lifetime is tied to
  the parent object (one can't exist without the other). **Aggregation** is more
  "has a" or "is in a"; like Ducks in a Pond. The Pond can dry up and the Ducks
  persist, and the Ducks can move between Ponds.

You can use composition as a replacement for inheritance in some cases. For
example, in our geometry example, we could have made Square inherit from Shape
instead, and hold a Rectangle as an attribute, and then use that Rectangle to
compute the methods of the Square. The benefit is that we now control the
interface Square provides completely; adding something to Rectangle does not add
it to Square unless we also wrap it there. For this case, it's not a great
design, but imagine if Rectangle was from somewhere we didn't control (and if
square was not as conceptually a variation of a rectangle is it really is!).

An important contributor to designing good classes is this: A child class cannot
remove attributes from a parent. It can override them or add new ones, but not
remove. Be very careful if you are exposing more public API than you want to!

### UML diagrams

UML, or Unified Modeling Language, is a method of displaying class diagrams
[(read more here)](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/what-is-UML-unified-modeling-language),
or read about it for
[mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/classDiagram), which is
supported quite a lot of places these days, including GitHub. Let's see what our
simple Geom example looks like:

```{mermaid}
classDiagram
    Shape <|-- Rectangle
    Rectangle <|-- Square
    Shape <|-- Triangle
    Shape <|-- Circle
    class Shape {
        +area()* float
        +parameter()* float
    }
    class Rectangle {
        +height: float
        +width: float
        +area() float
        +parameter() float
    }
    class Triangle {
        +a float
        +b float
        +c float
        +area() float
        +parameter() float
    }
    class Circle {
        +radius float
        +area() float
        +parameter() float
    }
    class Square {
        +side: float
    }
```

All the supported relationships are:

```{mermaid}
classDiagram
    classA --|> classB : Inheritance
    classC --* classD : Composition
    classE --o classF : Aggregation
    classG --> classH : Association
    classI -- classJ : Link(Solid)
    classK ..> classL : Dependency
    classM ..|> classN : Realization
    classO .. classP : Link(Dashed)
```

## SOLID

- **S**ingle responsibility.
  - Classes should aim to do one thing (modular) - can do more, but be careful!
  - Minimize number of reasons to alter a class/function/module, etc.
- **O**pen-closed principle.
  - Design your interfaces well, everything should conform to that.
  - API should be stable (closed) but extensible (open).
- **L**iskov substitution principle.
  - You should be able to substitute a child class anywhere a parent class is
    expected.
  - You should not remove arguments from an overloaded function, for example.
- **I**nterfaces should be specific and segregated.
  - You shouldn't depend on methods you don't use.
  - Protocols will really help with this - we'll get there in static typing!
  - You can add an interface class layer to limit access.
- **D**ependency inversion (depend on abstractions, not concretions)
  - High level code _should not_ depend on low level code details
    (implementations)
  - Low level code _should_ depend on high level abstractions.

Interfaces example:

Let's say Xerox makes a multifunction machine, with Stapler and Printer objects
of class Job. Job holds _everything_ for interacting with the machine -
printing, copying, stapling, etc. This quickly will become a maintenance
nightmare - what if Printer starts accessing Stapler functions (accidentally or
on purpose)? What if Xerox decides to make a copier that can't staple? There's
too much interdependency; this also makes testing much harder.

## Design principles

### Provide minimal public API

You should try to limit the Public API as much as possible. Everything you add
as public API means something someone might depend on and something you can't
easily refactor. Attributes or methods that are implementation details (not part
of the public API) should be hidden or have restricted access. Some languages
provide ways to forcibly lock down access; Python only provides convention with
an `_` at the start of names, but that's fine - use it with your methods and
don't use `_` methods of other classes.

In some languages, you should avoid/limit direct access to members, as this
could limit you from ever adding an operation that occurs when setting or
getting that value. This is _not_ an issue with Python, since the following
class:

```{code-cell} python3
class Container:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.x = x

c = Container(1)
print(f"{c.x = }")
c.x = 2
print(f"{c.x = }")
```

Can be refactored and still provide the same user API:

```{code-cell} python3
class Container:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self._x = x

    @property
    def x(self):
        print("Accessing x")
        return self._x

    @x.setter
    def x(self, value):
        print("Setting x")
        self._x = value

c = Container(1)
print(f"{c.x = }")
c.x = 2
print(f"{c.x = }")
```

## Object Oriented Programming design patterns

The following is a collection of design patterns for OOP.

### Code reuse

This is not the most common use, but is a really simple one, so let's start with
it.

If we have some code that has many steps:

```{code-cell} python3
class SteppedCode:
    def step_1(self):
        print("Working on step 1")
    def step_2(self):
        print("Working on step 2")
    def step_3(self):
        print("Working on step 3")
    def run(self):
        self.step_1()
        self.step_2()
        self.step_3()

SteppedCode().run()
```

You can then use inheritance to swap out arbitrary steps:

```{code-cell} python3
class NewSteps(SteppedCode):
    def step_2(self):
        print("Replaced step 2")

NewSteps().run()
```

We can also inject code around a step:

```{code-cell} python3
class SurroundedSteps(SteppedCode):
    def step_2(self):
        print("Before step 2")
        super().step_2()
        print("After step 2")

SurroundedSteps().run()
```

Real code likely will pass values around or use class attributes, but the idea
remains. That leads into the next, more common pattern.

### Required interface

This allows you to request a user specify an interface to use your code. For
example:

#### `integrator_example/integrator/__init__.py`

```{literalinclude} ./integrator_example/integrator/__init__.py
:language: python
:end-before: class EulerIntegrator(IntegratorBase)
```

To implement an integrator, we have to provide `compute_step`:

```{literalinclude} ./integrator_example/integrator/__init__.py
:language: python
:start-at: class EulerIntegrator(IntegratorBase)
:end-before: class RK4Integrator(IntegratorBase)
```

We can implement more:

```{literalinclude} ./integrator_example/integrator/__init__.py
:language: python
:start-at: class RK4Integrator(IntegratorBase)
```

The UML diagram is:

```{mermaid}
classDiagram
    IntegratorBase <|-- EulerIntegrator
    IntegratorBase <|-- RK4Integrator
    class IntegratorBase {
        integrate(f, t, init_y)
        compute_step(f, t_n, y_n, h)*
    }
    class EulerIntegrator {
        compute_step(f, t_n, y_n, h)
    }
    class RK4Integrator {
        compute_step(f, t_n, y_n, h)
    }
```

Now we can use it:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-cell]

import sys
sys.path.append("integrator_example")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

from integrator import EulerIntegrator, RK4Integrator


def f(t, y):
    "Y has two elements, x and v"
    return np.array([-1 * y[1], y[0]])

ts = np.linspace(0, 40, 1000 + 1)
euler = EulerIntegrator()
y_euler = euler.integrate(f, ts, [1, 0])
rk4 = RK4Integrator()
y_rk4 = rk4.integrate(f, ts, [1, 0])

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(ts, y_euler[:, 0], "--", label="Euler")
ax.plot(ts, y_rk4[:, 0], ":", lw=5, label="RK4")
ax.plot(ts, np.cos(ts), label="Analytical")
ax.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Functors

Functors are things that you can call, but hold some state as well. A classic
functor would be a counter. You can use classes to create Functors. Without
classes, you'd have to write something horrifying like this:

```{code-cell} python3
_start = 0


def incr():
    global _start
    _start += 1
    return _start

print(f"{incr() = }")
print(f"{incr() = }")
print(f"{incr() = }")
```

This has to use a global, and there can only be one of them; if you wanted two
counters, this design wouldn't work. You _could_ use capture and generate a new
function:

```{code-cell} python3
def make_incr():
    _start = 0
    def incr():
        nonlocal _start
        _start += 1
        return _start
    return incr

incr1 = make_incr()
incr2 = make_incr()
print(f"{incr1() = }")
print(f"{incr1() = }")
print(f"{incr2() = }")
print(f"{incr2() = }")
```

And in fact, when lambda functions (which include capture semantics) were added
to C++, the need for custom functors really decreased. However, the class
version of a counter is easier to read:

`````{tab-set}
````{tab-item} Dataclasses
```python
import dataclasses


class Incr:
    start: int = 0

    def __call__(self):
        self.start += 1
        return self.start


incr = Incr()
incr()
```
````
````{tab-item} Classic
```python
class Incr:
    def __init__(self, start=0):
        self.start = start

    def __call__(self):
        self.start += 1
        return self.start


incr = Incr()
incr()
```
````
`````

This is explicit, clear, multiple instances can be created without having them
interfere, I can see exactly what’s going on without having to trace down a
global, and you can even set the default value when you make a new instance!

### Separation of concerns

Classes allow you to organize code so that each each class addresses a specific
concern.

Some languages (Ruby, Rust) support partial classes, which can load portions
based on what you are interested in doing, but Python and C++ do not. Type
dispatch (C++, Julia) can be used as an alternative. Python has mixins, covered
below, which are not quite the same as partial classes, but provide similar
benefits. Ruby has both partial classes and mixins but not multiple inheritance.

### eDSLs

You can use classes to make embedded Domain Specific Languages (eDSLs). You can
build a custom mini-language on top of the Python syntax.

For example, let's say I want to make path-like objects that I can join with
`/`:

```{code-cell} Python
class Path(str):
    def __truediv__(self, other):
        return self.__class__(f"{self}/{other}")


print(Path("one") / Path("two"))
```

Just in case you want to make a `Path` class like the one above - don’t, use
`pathlib.Path` instead.

### Mixins

Multiple inheritance can be tricky to use, but a common, useful pattern is a
limited form of multiple inhertitance called mixins. With mixins, you provide a
few reusable features, and then compose the classes from one or more mixins,
with an optional superclass. Let's rewrite the Path example using mixins:

```
class PathMixin:
    def __truediv__(self, other):
        return self.__class__(f"{self}/{other}")


class Path(str, PathMixin):
    pass


print(Path("one") / Path("two"))
```

Notice we now built the mixin without subclassing anything - we could mix it
into any class we want later. We could mix in multiple classes if we wanted.
It's quite powerful. Just remember a few rules for simple mixins:

- Mixins shouldn't have `__init__`'s.
- Mixins shouldn't add members (since that should only be done in `__init__`)
- Mixins shouldn't have `super()` calls or overload something in the base class.
- Once we get to static typing, mixins should always have a Protocol to define
  what interface the class they mix into needs to have.

You _can_ bend these rules a bit, but then you are moving into multiple
inheritance territory, so be very careful.
