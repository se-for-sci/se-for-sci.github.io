# Introduction and Motivation

## Intro to git

Good practice in programming project management requires a version control
system.

Old school techniques are usually bad.

- Version filenames is a disaster.

  - mythesis_v1.tex, mythesis_v2.tex, mythesis_last_v3.tex
  - creates clutter
  - Filenames rarely contain information other than chronology
  - Parallel independent changes super hard to keep track of
  - Did you finally notice a problem in v119 that has been around for a while,
    but you have no idea where the error was introduced?

- Sharing files with others is a disaster.

  - Emailing files sucks --- only magnifies the problems above
  - Track changes feature Google Docs or Word --- not so useful for anything
    complex

- Disaster recover is a disaster.
  - Oh F#@K! Did I just overwrite all my work from last night??!!!?

Modern version control techniques are usually great.

Modern tools to promote collective intelligence.

- Automated history of everything

  - not just files, but whole projects with folders and subfolders
  - who, what, when, and (most important) why

- Automated sharing of everyone's latest edits

  - no more emailing files around

- Easier disaster recovery with distributed VCSes like Git or Mercurial (see
  later)

- Support for automated testing (we'll cover this in future lectures)

- Infinite sandboxes for clutter-free, fear-free experimentation

  - this is where Git especially shines -- main topic today

- CAVEAT 1: All of this works best with plain text files

- CAVEAT 2: All of this works best with a highly modular file structure

- The git feedback effect:
  - Using git encourages positive changes to your workflow.
  - And making your workflow more git-friendly will make your work better
    overall.

## Brief history of version control.

- Local Version Control

  - Mainly just reduced clutter and automated tracking of chronology...

- Centralized Version Control

  - Allows group work on the same files...
  - Single point of failure --- there is only a single "real" repository
  - Backing up is a separate process
  - File locks --- create "race conditions" for committing changes to that
    "real" repository
  - What if you lose internet?
  - Branching is cumbersome, so people don't do it (and have trouble reconciling
    disparate histories when they do)

- Distributed Version Control
  - Resolve most of the above issues...
  - Many separate and independent repos; all are "first-class" citizens
  - Can make commits locally even without internet...
  - ...but can transfer history and information between repositories
  - Branching is lightweight and easy (mainly in Git)

## Core concepts in git

Branches and DAGs

A DAG is a directed acyclic graph linking together a sequence of tasks.

Let's calibrate people's intuitions about git terminology: how many branches are
in this DAG?

Best way to get comfortable conceptually with git branching is to see it in
action.

So let's do an exercise...

Things to keep in mind during our exercise

- Just a quick tour

- There is always a PICSciE workshop on Git scheduled every year. Do it!

- Some git operations are of a "send it out" variety, while others are of a
  "bring it in" variety

  - important to keep straight which are of which flavor

- Some git operations are repo-wise, while others are branch-wise
